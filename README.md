## Cosuno coding challenge

Create a simple React application that shows a list of construction companies, each with the
following information:

- Company name
- Logo (you may use a placeholder image, e.g. using https://placekitten.com/)
- Specialties (e.g. Excavation, Plumbing, Electrical)
- City

The following should be possible:

- Search for a company by typing into a search field. The search term gets matched only
against the company name and the list of companies is filtered based on the search term
in real time as the user is typing.
- Filter the list using a set of checkboxes to include only those companies which offer a
particular speciality (e.g. only Plumbing).

Create a simple API based on Node.js that returns the list of companies to the frontend. The
API can read the data from a simple JSON source, no database setup is required.

In addition, make a list of ideas on how you would improve this application if you had more time
to work on it.
